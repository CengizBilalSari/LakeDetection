/**
 * This lake class is mainly created to determine lakes and  form their features.
 * The main aim of the project is to determine lakes' locations and their volumes,
 * so  Lake class has  2D volumes array,  array list for locations of lakes and array list for locations of adjacent volumes.

    The other two methods are doing the most critical job in this project. They are basically created with breadth first search algorithm.

    It returns their volumes' matrix which is the crucial array list for the remaining part.
